# My dotfiles

## Vim
This repository contains the dot files for vim (vimrc).

## nvim
This repository contains the dot files for neovim.

It is heavily based on the dotfiles from [LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim/) and [jsatk](https://github.com/jsatk/dotfiles/).

## Neomutt
I'm using the terminal mail reader neomutt.
